# CrushFS - Merciless Density at Any Cost

CrushFS primary goal is to provide maximum density without regard for performance. A best effort will be made to make the file system as performant as possible, but not at the cost of density. It's purpose is to provide an easy-to-use 
and configurable filesystem for archive data. Do have you a LOT of redundant backups with folders upon folders of duplicate data? Don't worry about sorting through all of it. "Crush" it and reclaim your disk space!

CrushFS works by mounting a CFS disk image as a drive letter of choosing. Beyond that it will manage all back-end compression, deduplication, and sizing of the backing file.
